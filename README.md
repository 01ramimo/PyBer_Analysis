# PyBer_Analysis

PyBer Analysis with Jupyter Notebook and Pandas to Inspect data, merge data sets, perform calculations and create data series and data frames

**Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to help PyBer, a ride sharing app, company by creating several types of data visualizations. These visualizations showcase the relationships between the type of city (Rural, Urban and Suburban), the number of drivers and the number of riders as well as the total percentage of total fares and riders. The different types of data visualization created helps to detect patterns, trends, correlations, and outliers. For instance, the percentage of drivers by city type (Rural, Urban and Suburban), the number of riders or the percentage of total fares by city type (Rural, Urban and Suburban). As a result, the company will use such information for project planning and decision making to help improve access to ride sharing services and also determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.

**Results

·        Urban cities have the highest numbers of rides, drivers, and total fares (1625, 2405 and 39854.38) respectively

·        Suburban cities have the second highest numbers of rides, drivers, and total fares (625, 490 and 19356.33) respectively.

·        Rural cities have the lowest numbers of rides, drivers, and total fares (125, 78, and 4327.93) respectively.

·        Lastly, comparing all the 3 cities type of cities (Rural, Urban and Suburban), the Rural cities seems to have the highest number of average fares per ride (34.6) and average fare per driver (55.5) compared to Urban cities and Rural cities.

**Summary

The data that was created helped to showcase the different relationships between the types of cities (Rural, Urban and Suburban), the number of drivers and riders, as well as the total percentage of total fares, riders, and the type of city respectively. Hence, from the data, an individual can predict the fare amount based on the city type where they are requesting ride services. For instance, if an individual was to travel to a rural area they would have to plan accordingly because according to the data, there’s a few numbers of drivers available for rural city services and the fares are a bit pricey compared to ride services in Urban cities. In conclusion, such data trends should help PyBer company develop and implement effective strategies that will help improve access to ride sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.

Hence, my recommendation to the company would be as follows:

1.      Introduce surge pricing – surge pricing will help distribute the number of drivers from different types of cities (Rural, Urban and Suburban)

2.      Implement incentive plans for drivers that provide more services to the underserved neighborhoods.

3.      Hire contractor drivers to work flexible hours (maybe more drivers are in the Urban and Suburban cities based on work and school locations with the most traffic). Hence, with the flexible hours the contract drivers should be available to pick up the rides.
